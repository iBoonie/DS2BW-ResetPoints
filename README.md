# Dungeon Siege 2 - Reset Skill Points

This is a fork of https://www.nexusmods.com/dungeonsiegeii/mods/17 but I have included both of the DLC classes so their points can be reset.
Should work fine in non-Broken World, but untested.

I have included the source if you want to take a peak in it. You can also decompile it, but you will need tankviewer: https://siegetheday.org/?q=node/2951

Note: This will not work with aranna legacy mod since both of them modify data_bar.gas. If you want to reset your skills, make sure to disable aranna legacy mod first.
